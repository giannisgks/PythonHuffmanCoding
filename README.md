# Huffman-Coding

The current code takes a text from a file and uses Huffman Coding to assign shorter codes to more frequent symbols and longer codes to less frequent symbols, minimizing the overall encoded length. It calculates the probability of occurance on each of the English alphabet letters, their binary code and prints the Entropy, the Average Code Length and the compression efficiency.
