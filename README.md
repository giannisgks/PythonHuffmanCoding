# Huffman-Coding


Huffman coding, developed by David A. Huffman in 1952, is a widely used compression algorithm. It assigns shorter codes to more frequent symbols and longer codes to less frequent ones, optimizing data storage. Huffman coding is the basis for various compression formats, such as JPEG and MP3. It's a key concept in information theory, providing efficient encoding with minimal redundancy. The algorithm's simplicity and effectiveness make it a fundamental tool in data compression.

The current code takes a text from a file and uses Huffman Coding to assign shorter codes
to more frequent symbols and longer codes to less frequent symbols, minimizing the overall
encoded length. It calculates the probability of occurance on each of the English alphabet
etters, their binary code and prints the Entropy, the Average Code Length and the compression
efficiency.
